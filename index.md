Here's a selection of  GitHub projects that I've been working on recently.

### Natural Neighbourhoods

[Natural Neighbourhoods](https://github.com/ewan-klein/natural-neighbourhoods)
is based on questionnaire data from Edinburgh residents gathered by
City of Edinburgh Council. It consists of a pairing of postcodes with
the name of the locality that the resident regards as their neighbourhood. The project tries to explore different ways of mapping this data.

### Trading Consequences

[digtrade](https://github.com/digtrade/digtrade) is the GitHub
repository for the
[Trading Consequences](http://tradingconsequences.blogs.edina.ac.uk)
project and contains some SKOS-based lexical resources. An overview of
the approach can be found in the paper
[Bootstrapping a historical commodities lexicon with SKOS and DBpedia](http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W/W14/W14-06.pdf#page=23).

    
### Carneades Argumentation
[carneades](https://github.com/ewan-klein/carneades) is a
pedagogically-oriented Python implement of the
[Carneades Argument Evaluation framework](http://carneades.github.io/carneades/Carneades/)
that closely follows the Haskell implementation in the
[CarneadesDSL package](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/CarneadesDSL).
