Here's a list of my GitHub projects that are more or less active.

### Natural Neighbourhoods

[Natural Neighbourhoods](https://github.com/ewan-klein/natural-neighbourhoods) is based on questionnaire data from Edinburgh residents gathered by City of Edinburgh Council. It consists of a pairing of postcodes with the name of the locality that the resident regards as their neighbourhood. The project tries to explore different ways of mapping this data.

### Trading Consequences

[digtrade](https://github.com/digtrade/digtrade) is the GitHub repository for the [Trading Consequences](http://tradingconsequences.blogs.edina.ac.uk) project and contains some SKOS-based lexical resources. An overview of the approach can be found in the paper [Bootstrapping a historical commodities lexicon with SKOS and DBpedia](http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W/W14/W14-06.pdf#page=23).
